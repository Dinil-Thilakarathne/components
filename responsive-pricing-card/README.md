# Responsive pricing cards with different pricing tiers 

This code will create three responsive pricing cards with different pricing tiers (Basic, Standard, and Premium). Each card will have a title, price, list of features, and a "Buy Now" button. The cards will be displayed in a flex container with responsive spacing. Feel free to customize the styles further based on your design preferences.
